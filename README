	g++
	libboost-all-dev 
	zlib1g-dev (its zlib_ONE_g, not zlib_L_g).
	cmake

2. RESOURCES
	Sharelin home: http://sharelin.sf.net

3. BUILDING

3.1 Building
	Suppose we have sharelin-0.2.0-src.tar.gz  
	Run following commands to build sharelin:

	1) tar gzvf sharelin-0.2.0-src.tar.gz
	2) cd sharelin-0.2.0
	3) cmake . (don't forget the dot =) )
	4) make (or gmake on FreeBSD and some other OS)

	Built binary file will be in ./sharelin/ folder. 

3.2 Installing	
	You could run sharelin without installation by running sharelin/sharelin
	(after you build it). But be sure to copy webui folder to ~/.sharelin/ 

	To install sharelin, run "make install" with root privilages. It will copy 
	binary file into your system default bin folder and webui into default 
	share (to share/sharelin/) folder.

3.3 Uninstalling
	When you run "make install" the file install_manifest.txt will be created.
	It contains all the file paths that are installed.
	Run "make uninstall" to delete the installed files.

4. USAGE

4.1 Command line options
	-h, --help          display help
	-d, --daemon        run in background
	-v n, --verbose n   set verbose level to n
	-c, --configure	    start configurer to set the options

4.2 Configuration file (~/.sharelin/sharelin.conf)
	If sharelin.conf doesn't exist, Sharelin will create it on the first run.
	You can run Sharelin, then shut it down (by pressing CTRL+C) and edit
	~/.sharelin/sharelin.conf
	See sharealin.conf_sample for options explanations. 
	You can rename it to sharelin.conf, edit and use.

4.3 Web UI
	To enable Web UI (webui) add some allowed ip ranges (see RemoteRanges 
	option) and specify web UI port (see WebUIPort) option.

4.4 Telnet commands
	nb - current G2 neighbors
	exit - exit telnet
	kill - kill core
	set var=value - sets the value of the internal variable. Example: set maxhubs=3
	sr - starts new search. Parameters: dn (descriptive name), min (minimum size),
		max (maximum size), media (media type), ext (extensions). Example:
		sr dn = "Debian Linux" min = 500Mb
		sr dn = "Debian Linux"
	srs - list all current searches
	srdel - removes search by id. Example: srdel id=2
	srstop - stops search by id. Example: srstop id=5
	srresume - resumes stopped search by id. Example: srresume id=5
	srshow - list results of the search by id. Example srshow id=2
	dl - starts new download. To download a file from search results, use
		search ID(sr) and result ID(id) within search. Example:
		dl sr=2 id=341
	dls - list all current downloads
	dlstop - stops download by id. Example: dlstop id=1
	dldel - removes download by id. Example: dlremove id=1
	dlresume - resumes stopped download by id. Example: dlresume id=1
	dlinfo - shows information about download. Example: dlinfo id=1
